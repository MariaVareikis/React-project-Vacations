Vacations Project

The project is a description of a vacation tagging system that allows users to view and tag vacations. The system consists of a server-side built with Node.js and Express with Secure Coding, a database using MySQL, and a client-side built with React and Redux.

View Vacations: Users can view vacations in a tabular format with pagination.
